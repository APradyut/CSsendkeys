# C# sendkeys.dll
The repository contains dll file and the source code for a dll file which can run in background of any program and can send key strokes. This dll file makes it easy for sending keys from programming languages which dont provide such features. 
The program can be used directly by including the sendkeys namespace and using the functions:
1. start()
    Parameters: 
        String of text that needs to be sent
    Returns: 
        NULL
2. Shortcuts:
    up = {UP};
    down = {DOWN};
    right = {RIGHT};
    left = {LEFT}
    
You can refer to form1.cs file for an example to use the dll file
